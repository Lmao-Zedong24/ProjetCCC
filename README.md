# ProjetCCC - BALZY

## 3D platforming game built with Unity. 

This is a ISART Digital final school project focused on building an interesting character controller. The team consisted of 4 game designer and 1 programmer. 
Our goal was to create a simple controller that would be polished over many iterations. For most of us, this was our first collaboration project, and we leared enormously through trail and error.
We ended up with a polished platformer with an intentionally "clunky" controller, which you slowly got the hang of.
The game is in the style of Getting Over It and Jump King, where you could lose a lot of progress if you missed a platforming section.

### Workflow
Our workflow consisted of:
* Detailed timeline on "Confluence"
* Followed basic GitFLOW structure
* Meeting at least twice a week
* Many iterations of our controller
* Discarded features for a better game feel
* Good communication between both teams
