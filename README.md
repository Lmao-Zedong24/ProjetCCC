#ProjetCCC - BALZY

## A 3D platforming game built with Unity. 

This is a ISART Digital final school project focused on building an interesting character controller. The team consisted of 4 game disingner and 1 programmer. 
Our goal was to create a simple controller that would be polished over many itterations. For most of us, this was our first collaboration project, and we leared enoumouslly through trail and error.
We endded up with a polished platformer whith an intentianlly "clunky" controller, which you slowlly got the hang of.
The game is in the style of Getting Over It and Jump King, where you could lose a lot of progress if you missed a platforming section.
